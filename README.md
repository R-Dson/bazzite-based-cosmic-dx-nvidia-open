# Cosmic Bazzite Images
This is mostly for my own use. Feel free to use them as well.

A collection of [Cosmic](https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-epoch) desktop images built on top of the [Bazzite](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite) Nvidia images. These images combine the hardware support and gaming optimizations of Bazzite with the Cosmic desktop environment.
